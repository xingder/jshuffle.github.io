# The Crow and the Water Bottle

![](https://cn.bing.com/th?id=OIP.kBsoav2FXKPP7m4q2UBcXwHaGy&pid=Api&rs=1)

It was a scorching hot summer day. One crow was very thirsty. "I'm so thirsty." The thirsty crow roamed around looking for water. After flying for a long time, the crow found a water bottle in one of the farmer's yard. The crow was so happy that he was able to have a drink.

The crow put his beak into the bottle. However, because the bottle was so long, he was not able to reach the water. The crow was exhausted.

'Should I go some other place for a drink?' He thought. However, because his wings were damage, he was not able to move. "What shall I do?”

The crow flew round and round the farmer's yard, and thought. "Sure, that's what I will do." The crow had an idea.

With all his strength, the crow started picking up stones. "One, two." He did this several times until the bottle was filled with stones. Then the crow drank a lot of water. Finally, the crow had enough strength to fly again.
